 Reminder: User can add different types of events and set alarm for that event.  Alarm:  User will be able to disable or enable snooze option for an alarm. User will be able to add puzzle to stop an alarm.   Focus: (Stopwatch): If user opens another app while running the stopwatch, the stopwatch will be killed. But user will also be able to use the normal stopwatch feature.  User will be provided with points based on their work hours.  Interest Based Bookmarker: User will be able to add different interests. User will be able to add bookmarks to those interests.    Motivation:  As the world has become smaller, the people have become more workaholic and productive. This is not true that they donâ€™t follow any productive routine. Many of us actually do maintain a strict routine. But very few of them maintain this routine using a tech based solution.   For some people, it may probably be personal preference. But for the rest of the people like us, are still searching for a user-friendly, easy to use, simple solution that can integrate all their personal productivity planning and make them follow their routine in a more convenient way.   So, this gave us the motivation to build something for them. Initially, it will only include the simple features. Later on, we hope to add more complex features to make it one of the most complete personal assistant apps.
