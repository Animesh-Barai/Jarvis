# Motivation:

As the world has become smaller, the people have become more workaholic and productive. This is not true that they donâ€™t follow any productive routine. Many of us actually do maintain a strict routine. But very few of them maintain this routine using a tech based solution.


For some people, it may probably be personal preference. But for the rest, it's just the absence of a user-friendly, easy to use, simple solution that can integrate all productivity planning and help people to follow their routine in a more convenient way. 

So, this gave us the motivation to work on Jarvis. Initially, it will only include the simple features. Later on, we hope to add more complex features to make it one of the most complete personal assistant apps.


# Features:
